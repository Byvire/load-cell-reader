\section*{Note}

I'm not an electrical engineer. Of course the warning in the MIT license applies to
everything in this repository, but I'll say a few redundant words here.

I've done everything that occurred to me to make the design safe for
people and hardware.  ``Safe for hardware'' means that, if it works
the way I intended, my circuit shouldn't have some failure mode where
the 12 volts from the gaggle of AA batteries ends up ruining the
Raspberry Pi, the load cell, or any other component. But I could be
wrong.

I don't know how I could possibly mess ``safe for people''. But what do I know? I'm not
an electrical engineer.

In broad strokes, here's why I did things the way I did:
\begin{itemize}
\item The AD8237 units are instrumentation amplifiers. You can find their data sheets
  online.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item One AD8237 monitors the battery 

Look at $R_1$, $R_3$, and $R_5$.
