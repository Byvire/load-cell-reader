This circuit can be used to take measurements from the load cell.

I made this design using a lovely free open-source program called
Kicad.  I'm not sure whether the other files in this directory count
as "software", but they are provided in the prefered form for making
changes to them, at least with Kicad, so feel free to do that.  Also,
the software isn't very useful without these files.

If there's no other documentation for the design than this README,
it's probably because I'm still working my way through the TODO
file. Until then, rest assured that I did actual math to choose the
resistor values.  (I'm not an electrical engineer, though. And
obviously, the disclamer part of the MIT license applies to this
circuit as well.)
