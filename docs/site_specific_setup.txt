This document describes where to connect the necessary wires to the circuit,
as I implemented it on a breadboard.

Prerequisite: Look up the layout of wires in a breadboard so that this all
makes sense. You'll notice that it's totally fine to ignore the exact
letter coordinates listed below but not okay to ignore the column numbers.

Also, at least one of the loose wires I left in the box will be extraneous.

In the circuit I made, here's where to attach the wires from the load cell:

+EXCITATION goes to the positive (red) power row on the right.
-EXCITATION goes to the negative (blue) power row on the right.
+OUTPUT goes to row 23, column I or J. (This is near the big cigar-like
resistor labeled "MEXICO".)
-OUTPUT goes to row 25, column I or J. (There's a green wire here.)

By the pin descriptions on the data sheet for the load cell (LMC111-10), I
wrote down which color wire connects to which pin. But if that goes missing,
the pin descriptions can also be found on

Here's where to attach the raspberry pi pins. pinout.xyz is a great source
for Raspberry Pi pin descriptions.

3v3 Power goes to the positive (red) power row on the left.
Ground goes to the negative (blue) power row on the left.
BCM 2 (SDA) goes to row 13 G, by the SDA pin of the ADS1015.
BCM 3 (SCL) goes to row 12 G, by the SCL pin of the ADS1015.
BCM 4 goes to row 2 B.


Here's where to connect the battery, though you could probably guess:

The positive end should connect to the positive (red) lane on the right.
The negative end should connect to the negative (blue) lane on the right.
