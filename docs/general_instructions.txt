Assuming you have a working installation of Raspbian Jessie already.

This is an outline of the instructions, for more advanced users.
There's a more detailed version below.

Use apt-get to install:

build-essential
python-dev
python-setuptools
setup-tools
python-pip
python-smbus
git

Use pip to install:

RPi.GPIO

Clone the following repositories with Git:

https://github.com/Adafruit/Adafruit_Python_GPIO
https://github.com/super-ego-man/Adafruit_ADS1x15
https://github.com/super-ego-man/THIS-REPO

For each of those, do
python setup.py install

Finally, you'll want to enable the GPIO pins. Google it.
Just kidding. I like these instructions:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's the more detailed version of what I summarized above:

Note that if, at any step, you get an error that says "permission denied",
you can simply try again but prefix your instruction with "sudo".

Here's a simple example: https://xkcd.com/149/

STEP 1:

First update your system. Do this by running:

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

It's a good habit to run these commands every time you turn on your Pi. After
the first time you run it, it won't take very long again.
If the above does not work, then your Pi is probably not connected to the
internet.

Now run these commands to install everything you should need:

   sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-setuptools
   sudo apt-get install setup-tools python-pip python-smbus git

If, in one of the later steps, you see an error message telling you to install
something else, you can install it in the same way.
("sudo apt-get install SOMETHING" installs the package called "SOMETHING".)

STEP 2:

To install some python-specific stuff, do this:

   pip install RPi.GPIO

This may be installed by default. If you experience problems, you
might consider installing RPi.GPIO by following the instructions on this
page:
http://openmicros.org/index.php/articles/94-ciseco-product-documentation/raspberry-pi/217-getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-gpio-and-python

STEP 3:

Install a few more things. To prepare for this part, I recommend making
a dedicated folder for the items that you'll install next. Do this:

   mkdir -p ~/Repo

You'll follow a certain procedure for each URL
in this list:

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_GPIO.git
https://github.com/super-ego-man/Adafruit_Python_ADS1x15.git
https://github.com/super-ego-man/THIS-REPO

Here's the procedure. Replace URL with the url from the list above.

   cd ~/Repo
   git clone URL

A new directory (folder) will be created. Its name will be the last part of the
URL. I'll call that directory DIRECTORY.

   cd DIRECTORY
   python setup.py install

That's all. Remember to try again with "sudo" if you see "permission denied".

STEP 4:

Follow the instructions here to configure I2C. (I2C is how the 'Pi talks to the
ADS1015.)
